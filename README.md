This repository includes all data and R scripts (i.e., RMD files) that were used in the experiment that examined the effect of different ITLN1 concentrations (i.e., 0, 10, 100 and 500 ng/ml) on skeletal muscle cells.
For the experiment that measured skeletal muscle glucose uptake rates, there are 2 files: the Rmd file (i.e., the script) and a CSV file (with raw luminescence values). 
For western blotting, we measured the ratio between pAkt and total Akt and puromycin incorporation. The Rmd file includes analyses for both measurements. There are to separate CSV files that contain the data (one for the ratio between pAkt and total Akt and another one for puromycin incorporation).
For qPCR data analysis, 2 different plates were ran (due to the high number of samples). The Rmd file includes the analysis for both plates. Additionally, for each plate, we have 3 files: qpcr_plate, pheno_plate and geNorm_qPCR. These will be required in order to run the analysis.
